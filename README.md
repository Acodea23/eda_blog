Thanks for checking out this repo! 
This repository contains code and analysis for an exploratory data analysis (EDA) blog post examining the impact of COVID-19 on mortality rates across different demographic groups in the US. 
These groups are defined by their race, gender, and education level. We utilize mortality data for each of these groups in both 2019 and 2020. The mortality data is also broken down by different age groups. This is important as we can determine what proportion of deaths in each demograhphic groups occured in each age level.
We can then compare the proportional mortality rates from 2019 to the proportional covid death rates in 2020 to see how demographic groups were affected differently by the pandemic.
We hope to prepare data to better understand which demographic groups were more susceptible to covid-19 related deaths in younger age levels.

To learn more about the data, go to this CDC [website](https://data.cdc.gov/National-Center-for-Health-Statistics/AH-Deaths-by-Educational-Attainment-2019-2020/4ueh-89p9/about_data)
**quick_eda.ipynb** is where you will find my work to prepare and explore the data.
**covid_death_demographics.csv** contains my cleaned data as a csv
**app.py** is still a work in progress to create a streamlit app.
